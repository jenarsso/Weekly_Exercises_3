## Setting up on GitHub!

Before starting your assignment, you need to get yourself set up on GitHub and make sure GitHub is connected to R Studio. To do that, you should read the instruction (through the "Cloning a repo" section) and watch the video [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md). Then, do the following (if you get stuck on a step, don't worry, I will help! You can always get started on the homework and we can figure out the GitHub piece later):

* Create a repository on GitHub, giving it a nice name so you know it is for the 3rd weekly exercise assignment (follow the instructions in the document/video).  
* Copy the repo name so you can clone it to your computer. In R Studio, go to file --> New project --> Version control --> Git and follow the instructions from the document/video.  
* Download the code from this document and save it in the repository folder/project on your computer.  
* In R Studio, you should then see the .Rmd file in the upper right corner in the Git tab (along with the .Rproj file and probably .gitignore).  
* Check all the boxes of the files in the Git tab and choose commit.  
* In the commit window, write a commit message, something like "Initial upload" would be appropriate, and commit the files.  
* Either click the green up arrow in the commit window or close the commit window and click the green up arrow in the Git tab to push your changes to GitHub.  
* Refresh your GitHub page (online) and make sure the new documents have been pushed out.  
* Back in R Studio, knit the .Rmd file. When you do that, you should have two (as long as you didn't make any changes to the .Rmd file, in which case you might have three) files show up in the Git tab - an .html file and an .md file. The .md file is something we haven't seen before and is here because I included `keep_md: TRUE` in the YAML heading. The .md file is a markdown (NOT R Markdown) file that is an interim step to creating the html file. They are displayed fairly nicely in GitHub, so we want to keep it and look at it there. Click the boxes next to these two files, commit changes (remember to include a commit message), and push them (green up arrow).  
* As you work through your homework, save and commit often, push changes occasionally (maybe after you feel finished with an exercise?), and go check to see what the .md file looks like on GitHub.  
* If you have issues, let me know! This is new to many of you and may not be intuitive at first. But, I promise, you'll get the hang of it! 



## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week. Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(day = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, day) %>% 
  summarize(tot_weight = sum(weight)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "day",
              values_from = "tot_weight")
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the `plot` variable from the `plant_date_loc` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  summarize(tot_harvest = sum(weight)*0.00220462) %>% 
  left_join(plant_date_loc, 
            by =c("vegetable", "variety"))
```


Sometimes the harvest is given as the same for two different plots since which plot each individual harvest came from might not have been completely recorded, but were rather done in group. We could fix this by recording each individual harvest from each plot, or for example divide redistribute the weight according to the number of seeds, which is recorded, planted in each plot. 



  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `supply_cost` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.

For this exercise, I will assume the price in supply_costs is per pound of seed. You could join the supply_costs dataset with the garden_harvest dataset and data from for example Whole Foods. We would mutate the Whole Foods data to get the price per pound for each variety of each vegetable. Then we would calculate the difference in the price per pound of seed and the price per pound of comercial produce for each variety and vegetable. Then we would multiply this difference by the total harvest in pounds for each vegetable and variety. Summing up all of these values will render the total amount of money saved.

Of course, there are other costs of growing your own produce such as soil or fertilizer that make this more complicated. We could assume a small additional cost per pound of seed for things like soil and fertilizer.


  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  summarize(tot_harvest_lbs = sum(weight)*0.00220462, min_date = min(date)) %>% 
  mutate(variety = fct_reorder(variety, min_date)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = variety, x = tot_harvest_lbs)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(title="Tomato Harvests in lbs", x= " ")
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(variety_lower = str_to_lower(variety),
         variety_length = str_length(variety_lower)) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, variety_lower) %>% 
  summarize(variety_length) %>% 
  distinct(variety_lower, variety_length) %>% 
  arrange(vegetable, variety_length)       #maybe have to group by vegetable
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(variety_er_ar = str_detect(variety, "er|ar")) %>% 
  filter(variety_er_ar == "TRUE") %>% 
  distinct(vegetable, variety, variety_er_ar)
```


## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

<center>

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){300px}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){300px}

</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usualy, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sdate)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Bike usage" , x = "Date")
```
  


As the weather gets colder, bike usage decreases. Sudden drops might be weather related, too.


  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute = minute(sdate),
         time_of_day = hour + minute/60) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time_of_day))+
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Bike usage over a day", x = "Time of Day")
```
  
  
Rush hours in early morning and afternoon are the most common times for bike rentals. 

  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%  
  mutate(day = weekdays(sdate)) %>%
  mutate(day = fct_rev(fct_relevel(day,  #so sorry, this is in Swedish... My computer language is Swedish and not sure how to change this...
                                   c("Måndag", "Tisdag", "Onsdag", "Torsdag", "Fredag", "Lördag", "Söndag")))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=day)) + 
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title= "Bike usage by day of the week")
```
  
  

Bike usage is fairly constant, but peaks on Thursdays and is lower on weekends. This is likely because registered bikers who use bikes for transit don't go to work on weekends.


  10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute = minute(sdate),
         time_of_day = hour + minute/60) %>% 
    mutate(day = weekdays(sdate)) %>%
  mutate(day = fct_relevel(day,  #so sorry, this is in Swedish... My computer language is Swedish and not sure how to change this...
                                   c("Måndag", "Tisdag", "Onsdag", "Torsdag", "Fredag", "Lördag", "Söndag"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time_of_day))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(vars(day)) +
  labs(title = "Bike usage over days of the week", x = "Time of Day")
```
  
  
The weekdays look similar, with peaks at rush hours. This suggests use for transit to work.  Weekends have a high usage in the afternoons, suggesting more recreational use.

The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises. Repeat the graphic from Exercise \@ref(exr:exr-temp) (d) with the following changes:

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute = minute(sdate),
         time_of_day = hour + minute/60) %>% 
    mutate(day = weekdays(sdate)) %>%
  mutate(day = fct_relevel(day,
                                   c("Måndag", "Tisdag", "Onsdag", "Torsdag", "Fredag", "Lördag", "Söndag"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time_of_day))+
  geom_density(aes(fill=client), alpha= .5, color=NA) +
  facet_wrap(vars(day)) +
  labs(title ="Bike usage over days of the week by client category", x = "Time of Day")
``` 



Registered bikers seem to be using bikes for transit to get to work because usage peaks during rush hours. Casual bikers use bikes similarly across all days, peaking in the afternoon.


  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute = minute(sdate),
         time_of_day = hour + minute/60) %>% 
    mutate(day = weekdays(sdate)) %>%
  mutate(day = fct_relevel(day,
                                   c("Måndag", "Tisdag", "Onsdag", "Torsdag", "Fredag", "Lördag", "Söndag"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time_of_day))+
  geom_density(aes(fill=client), alpha= .5, color=NA, position=position_stack()) +
  facet_wrap(vars(day)) +
  labs(title ="Bike usage over days of the week by client category", x = "Time of Day")
```



I think this one is less clear. It's hard to see where the casual client category starts and ends since it is stacked on the registered client category. This graph might be better for distinguishing the client categories. The previous graph can sometimes obscure the other category, which is not an issue here.

  13. Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute = minute(sdate),
         time_of_day = hour + minute/60,
         day = weekdays(sdate),
         day = fct_relevel(day,
                           c("Måndag", "Tisdag", "Onsdag", "Torsdag", "Fredag", "Lördag", "Söndag")),
         wknd = ifelse(day %in% c("Lördag", "Söndag"), "Weekend", "Weekday")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time_of_day))+
  geom_density(aes(fill=client), alpha= .5, color=NA, position=position_stack()) +
  facet_wrap(vars(wknd)) +
  labs(title = "Bike usage by weekday and weekend", x = "Time of Day")
```
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute = minute(sdate),
         time_of_day = hour + minute/60,
         day = weekdays(sdate),
         day = fct_relevel(day,
                           c("Måndag", "Tisdag", "Onsdag", "Torsdag", "Fredag", "Lördag", "Söndag")),
         wknd = ifelse(day %in% c("Lördag", "Söndag"), "Weekend", "Weekday")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=time_of_day))+
  geom_density(aes(fill=wknd), alpha= .5, color=NA, position=position_stack()) +
  facet_wrap(vars(client)) +
  labs(title = "Bike usage of casual and registered clients by weekday and weekend", x = "Time of Day")
```
 
 
I think the previous facet is more intuitive since dividing up by client category seems like a clearer category. This graph also has advantages, though. For example, it makes clear what type of usage each client category seeks with bike rentals. Casual users use it mostly recreationally no matter weekend or weekday. However, it is clear that registered users use their rentals on rush hours on weekdays, and like casual clients on weekends.
### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r}
Stations %>% 
  inner_join(Trips,
            by = c("name" = "sstation")) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(count_departures = n(), long, lat) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=long, y=lat, color = count_departures)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_continuous_tableau() +
  labs(title = "Longitude and latitude of stations", color = "Number of departures")
```
  
  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  
```{r}
Stations %>% 
  inner_join(Trips,
            by = c("name" = "sstation")) %>% 
  select(name, long, lat, client) %>% 
  group_by(name, long, lat) %>% 
  summarize(prop_casual=mean(client=="Casual")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=long, y=lat, color = prop_casual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Proportion casual", title = "Longitude and latitude of stations")
```
  
  
  
  It seems that stations concentrated in the urban center have higher proportions of casual users.
### Spatiotemporal patterns

  17. Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Save this to a new dataset and print out the dataset. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format. 
  
```{r}
top_trip_dates <- Trips %>% 
  mutate(date = as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  group_by(sstation, date) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_trips = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_of_trips)) %>% 
  slice_max(n=10, order_by = number_of_trips, with_ties = FALSE)
```
  
  18. Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from the previous part.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
    mutate(date = as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  inner_join(top_trip_dates,
             by = c("sstation", "date"))
```
  
  19. Build on the code from the previous problem (ie. copy that code below and then %>% into the next step.) and group the trips by client type and day of the week (use the name, not the number). Find the proportion of trips by day within each client type (ie. the proportions for all 7 days within each client type add up to 1). Display your results so day of week is a column and there is a column for each client type. Interpret your results.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
    mutate(date = as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  inner_join(top_trip_dates,
             by = c("sstation", "date")) %>% 
  mutate(day = weekdays(sdate),
         day = fct_rev(fct_relevel(day, 
                                   c("Måndag", "Tisdag", "Onsdag", "Torsdag", "Fredag", "Lördag", "Söndag")))) %>%
  group_by(day, client) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  group_by(client) %>% 
  mutate(total = sum(count), prop = count/total) %>%
  select(day, client, prop) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = day,
               names_from = client,
               values_from = prop)
```

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
